					<h2>Career</h2>
					<p> Robert Lewandowski, born 21 August 1988, is a Polish professional footballer who plays as a striker for Bayern Munich and is the captain of the Poland national team. He is renowned for his positioning, technique and finishing, and is widely regarded as one of the best strikers of his generation.
			Prior to the start of the 2014–15 season, Lewandowski agreed to join Dortmund's domestic rivals, Bayern Munich, on a free transfer. In Munich, he won the Bundesliga title in each of his first five seasons, earning a spot in the Bundesliga Team of the Year in every season. In 2015–16, 2017–18 and 2018–19, he led the league in goalscoring, and in 2016–17 he was named the Bundesliga Player of The Year. He was named to the UEFA Champions League Squad of the Season two times, and is the fourth-highest goalscorer in the history of the competition. He has scored over 200 goals in the Bundesliga, having reached the century mark quicker than any other foreign player, and is the league's all-time leading foreign goalscorer. He also holds the record for the fastest five goal haul in any major European football league since records have been kept after scoring five times in nine minutes against Wolfsburg in 2015.</p>
